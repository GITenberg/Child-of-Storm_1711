description: "Child of Storm is a 1913 novel by H. Rider Haggard featuring Allan Quatermain.\
  \ The plot is set in 1854-56 and concerns Quatermain hunting in Zululand and getting\
  \ involved with Mameema, a beautiful African girl who causes great turmoil in the\
  \ Zulu kingdom.\nThe novel is the second in a trilogy by Haggard involving the collapse\
  \ of the Zulu kingdom and featuring the dwarf Zikali. The first book is Marie, and\
  \ the third, Finished.\nThe story takes place against the real life struggle between\
  \ Cetshwayo and Umbelazi, the two sons of the Zulu king Mpande (called \"Panda\"\
  \ in the novel). The events culminate in the Battle of Ndondakusuka (here called\
  \ the \"Battle of the Tugela\") in 1856. Real life people such as Panda, Cetshwayo,\
  \ and John Robert Dunn appear as characters.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
